NRA direct support includes contributions from the NRA PAC and employees to caniddates.  Indirect support includes independent expenditures (and electioneering communications) supporting the candidate; opposition is IEs and ECs opposing the candidate.  ""Independent expenditures for opponent"" is spending by the NRA supporting a candidate OTHER than the member listed (note that could be someone of the same party, if they supported someone else in the primary), and ""Indep Expend against opponent"" is spending by the NRA opposing a candidate OTHER than the member listed. For the grand total, we summed the direct support + indirect support + indep expend against opponent, and then subtracted indirect opposition and inderect expenditures for the opponent.  This produces a grand total, which can be, and often is, negative. A negative value indicates that the NRA tends opposes this member.
